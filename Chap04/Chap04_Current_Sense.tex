\subsection{Current Sense :}

As elaborated in the BMS architecture High precision current sensors are used to monitor the BMS Currents. The currents are mainly monitored by the sensor charging current that is entering through the Battery pack Top and balancing current that is entering or leaving from the DC to Dc convert to the Balancing node from Battery pack TOP.

For Inventvm active balancing BMS application, The team has selected INA238 Current sensor from Texas instruments. The chapter(Current and Voltage Synchronization for BMS application) gives an extensive explanation for choosing the INA238\cite{INA238_User_Datasheet} and the application.
