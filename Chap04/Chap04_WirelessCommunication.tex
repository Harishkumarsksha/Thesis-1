\subsection{Wireless Communication Hardware :}
The Bed Rock Idea behind the Inventvm active balancing BMS is to make the BMS architecture in the Wireless Communication Environment. The wireless communication architecture will reduce the immense pain of hard wires for communication in modern smart EVs. The Wireless Communication picked for the project is the Bluetooth stack, Chapter \ref{chap:BLE} takes the privilege to explain the Bluetooth Hardware choosing criteria, and design the proprietary Bluetooth solution for the projects. The BLUeNRG-355MC\cite{BLNRG355_STEVAL_GUIDE} and the Nordic\cite{NORDIC_nrf52840_USERGUIDE} are the Bluetooth solutions employed in the project.
