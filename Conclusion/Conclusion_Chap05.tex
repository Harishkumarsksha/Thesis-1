\section*{Conclusion of Chapter \ref{ch:Battery_SOC_Estimation_Algorithms}}

Chapter \ref{ch:Battery_SOC_Estimation_Algorithms} is the most decorative and lavishing chapter. This chapter employs all the chapters that I have described previously. And the 5th chapter concludes the soc estimation algorithms. It also addresses the most advanced alorithms with descriptive math.

The first few sections made an effort to explain the classical coulomb counting approach and its drawbacks of it. Later sections address resolving the noise problems seen in the coulomb count method through the Kalman approach. Kalman algorithm took a bit of a long approach to resolve the soc estimation issue and converged to the real soc. Nonetheless, it opened new doors for upgraded algorithms like EKF, UKF and AUKF.

Sub Kalman algorithms(EKF, UKF, and AUEKF) that I have discussed in chapter 5 are not only the algorithms left for soc calculations. There is a wide ocean of algorithms is there to explore in the machine learning and AI field. I made a clear attempt to differentiate in the 5th chapter the benefits and drawbacks of using AI due to a lack of data. Nonetheless, I would like to see my future research more on AI and neural networks for EVs.
