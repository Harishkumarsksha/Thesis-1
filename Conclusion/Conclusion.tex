\chapter*{Conclusion}
Undoubtedly it's been a wonderful time all over my thesis period. Now it's time to conclude my thesis and make some takeaways from it. The idea of my thesis much diversified and multidisciplinary. Throughout the project, I have entirely dedicated myself to understanding every problem statement we encountered and bringing it to the team. It has been a joyful moment that every problem in the process, gave me intellectual knowledge to think in terms of hardware and software perspective.

Since my thesis is multidisciplinary I partitioned each disciplinary chapter by chapter. I would follow the same approach in the following section to conclude my thesis in each discipline, which includes hardware, software, and even design.
