\SpecialTitle{Abstract}
The enduring theme in the development of vehicle technology is "safety, energy conservation, and environmental protection." With the current global energy crisis and the severity of environmental issues rising, new energy vehicles—represented by electric vehicles—have emerged as the trend for automobile development going forward. The safe and effective use of batteries, which is one of the fundamental technologies of electric vehicles, depends on an accurate assessment of battery state.
To achieve this goal the theme of the thesis follows:\\
\noindent \textit{
    Determining the SOC ad SOH of the Li-Ion batteries by employing the Conventional Coloumb count method and sophisticated Kalman filter algorithms in a wireless communication network(BLE). 
    The proposed Architecture measures synchronized current and voltage for SOC and SOH calculation by ensuring safety and adaptivity. 
    By employing the Most Robust and Elegant Wireless Communication Network(BLE) in BMS, the architecture mitigates the problem of bulky and wired setups.
