\section{Introduction}


Antenna design and analysis are crucial in a wireless network that transmits and receives information through electromagnetic wave radiation in open space.
Modern Antenna and RF design techniques are more often testified against size, power, flexibility, radiation patterns, efficiency, etc...
It is very unusual to use a wide variety of RF fundamental design techniques even though the usage of silicon and power is different because the fundamentals of RF design are most rigorous and robust from decades, hence RF fundamentals and design techniques remain intact. Nevertheless, modern RF applications demand to emphasize efficiency and power requirements, so this requirement needs some special RF Design treatments.
Chapter .3 gives the extravagance of PCB antenna design practices, general guidelines for grounding, PCB stacking, spacings and via holes, etc. Matching networks in RF design are extremely important to increase the efficiency of the Antenna and RF line, so it is also explored in the same chapter how to pick the passive components for RF Antenna matching such as capacitors and inductors.

\section{Antenna Basics :}

An Antenna is a piece of metal exposed to free space. A piece of conductor behaves like an antenna when its length is a certain ratio or multiple of the wavelength of the signal. This scenario is expressed as "resonance", where the antenna radiates the electrical energy to the open space.

	\label{BASIC_ANTENNA}
\end{figure}

Fig.1  shows the dipole antenna whose length is  $\lambda/2$ and the fed has an input impedance of $50\Omega $.
Dipole antennas are the most basic antennas that have been used for broadcasting.
In the Millennial age of technology, dipole antennas have been bulky and heavy, thanks to the PCB technology, which made dipole antennas extremely simple in construction and this became the center of attraction for the Bluetooth application in the modern era.
Although dipole antennas are extremely comfortable for PCB we still face hurdles to manage proper grounding for the antenna..which can be addressed through quarter-wave antennas.
The quarter-wave antennas have half of the length of the dipole antennas  $\lambda/4$, their popularity became exponential because of the fed which can be single-ended.
A single-ended feed to the antenna made life much easier to make a wide range of ground planes and better matching.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Antenna Types:}

As discussed in the previous section quarter wavelength antennas can be more effective on the PCB because of their fed and ground plane management on PCB.
Depending on the antenna dimensions and the shape of antennas fall into different technologies namely FM, AM, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and so on.
Since the eccentric part of this chapter discusses the Bluetooth antenna design and guidelines, we can broadly classify three types of antennas. As follows :

\subsubsection{Wire Antenna :}
These types of antennas are just a piece of wire extended over the PCB in open space, whose length is matched to $\dfrac{\lambda}{4}$ on the ground plane.
In general, these antennas are fed by a $50\Omega  $ matching transmission line, a Wire antenna gives a top-notch performance and supports a wide range of frequencies because of its three-dimensional exposure in open space.
The shape of the wire antennas can be loop, wire, or helix.. depending on the application the shape is changed.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/Wire_antenna.PNG}
	\caption{Wire Antenna}
	\label{WIRE_ANTENNA}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{ PCB Antenna :}Constructively this type of antenna is copper traces
that are etched on the PCB. The Traces can be Zig-Zag, straight, MIFA, Meandered type, F-type, or Zip track so on.,
the shape of the antenna is chosen based on the antenna type and the space constraints on the PCB. PCB Antennas have only two-dimensional freedom, therefore certain guidelines are needed for the PCB antenna design due to the space constraints and poor quality of PCB stack-up.
The space constraints of the PCB antennas lead to less efficiency compared with wire antennas nonetheless PCB antennas are cost-effective.
In short manufacturing comfortability and its wireless range is ravishing for Bluetooth applications.

	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/PCB_Antenna.PNG}
	\caption{PCB Antenna}
	\label{PCB_ANTENNA}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{ Chip Antenna :} This is a Small form factor IC that is in-house with a ceramic package or some metal case.
These antennas are handier in terms of space management on the board and internally their impendence is very well managed.
A chip antenna can also take an advantage of three-dimensional freedom for radiation similar to wire antennas.
Refer to figure 10 for the Nordic Bluetooth module having a chip antenna.
Chip antennas can indeed gain upper hand in size and radion pattern on the contrary power handling capacity of the chip antenna is very minimal.

	\caption{Chip Antenna}
	\label{CHIP_ANTENNA}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Antenna Parameters}

The following section gives some key antenna performance parameters.

\subsubsection{Return loss :}

The return loss of an antenna signifies how well the antenna is matched to the 50-Ω transmission line (TL), shown as a signal feed in Figure \ref{fig: ANTENNA_RETUNRNLOSS}. The TL characteristic impedance is typically 50 Ω, although it could be a different value. The industry standard for commercial antennas and testing equipment is 50-Ω impedance, so it is most convenient to use this value \cite{AN91445}. \\
	
\indent  Return loss indicates how much of the incident power is reflected by the antenna due to mismatch (Equation \ref{eq:Antenna_Returnloss}).
An ideal antenna when perfectly matched will radiate the entire energy without any reflection. If the return loss is infinite, the antenna is said to be perfectly matched to the TL, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ANTENNA_RETUNRNLOSS}. S11 is the negative return loss expressed in decibels. In most cases, a return loss ≥ 10 dB (equivalently, S11 ≤ –10 dB) is considered sufficient. Table \ref{tb:ANTENNA_RETURNlOSS_TABLE} relates the return loss (dB) to the power reflected from the antenna (percent). 
A return loss of 10 dB signifies that $90\%$ of the incident power goes into the antenna for radiation \cite{AN91445}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Antenna_Returnloss}
    \begin{split}
        Returnloss(db) = 10 \times \log( \frac{Pincident}{Preflected})
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/Antenna_ReturnLoss.PNG}
	\caption{Antenna Return loss}
	\label{fig:ANTENNA_RETUNRNLOSS}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c| }
		\hline 
		S11 (dB) & Return Loss (dB) & $\varGamma_{ref}$/$\varGamma_{inc}$ $(\%)$ & $\varGamma_{rad}$/$\varGamma_{inc}$ (\%) \\ 
		\hline
		–20 &20 &1 &99\\
		\hline
		–3 &3 &50 &50\\
		\hline
		–10 &10 &10& 90\\
		\hline
		–1 &1 &79 &21\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Return Loss and Power reflected from antenna}
	\label{tb:ANTENNA_RETURNlOSS_TABLE}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Bandwidth :}

Bandwidth indicates the frequency response of an antenna. It signifies how well the antenna is matched to the 50-Ω transmission line over the entire band of interest, that is, between 2.40 GHz and 2.48 GHz for BLE applications \cite{AN91445}.\\

	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/Antenna_Bandwidth.PNG}
		\caption{Antenna Bandwidth}
		\label{fig:ANTENNA_BANDWIDTH}
	\end{figure}

As Figure \ref{fig:ANTENNA_BANDWIDTH} shows, the return loss is greater than 10 dB from 2.33 GHz to 2.55 GHz. Therefore, the bandwidth of 
interest is around 200 MHz. Wider bandwidth is preferred in most cases, because it minimizes the effect of detuning 
resulting from the changes in the environments around the antenna in actual uses of the product (e.g. mouse placed 
on wood/metal/plastic table, hand kept around the mouse, etc.) \cite{AN91445}

\subsubsection{Radiation efficiency: }

A portion of the non-reflected power (see Figure \ref{eq:Antenna_Returnloss}) gets dissipated as heat or as thermal 
loss in the antenna. Thermal loss is due to the dielectric loss in the FR4 substrate and the conductor loss in the 
copper trace. This information is characterized as radiation efficiency. The radiation efficiency of 100 percent indicates 
that all non-reflected power is radiated to free space. For a small-form-factor PCB, the heat loss is minimal \cite{AN91445}.

\subsubsection{Radiation pattern:}
Radiation pattern indicates the directional property of radiation, that is, which directions have 
more radiation and which have less. This information helps to orient the antenna properly in an application \cite{AN91445}.\\


\indent An isotropic dipole antenna radiates equally in all directions in the plane perpendicular to the antenna axis. However, 
most antennas deviate from this ideal behavior. See the radiation pattern of a PCB antenna shown in Figure \ref{fig:ANTENNA_RADIATION_PATTERN} as an 
illustration. Each data point represents RF field strength, measured by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in 
the receiver. As expected, the contours are not exactly circular, as the antenna is not isotropic \cite{AN91445}.


\subsubsection{Gain :}
Gain indicates the radiation in the direction of interest compared to the isotropic antenna, which radiates 
uniformly in all directions. This is expressed in terms of dBi—how strong the radiation field is compared to an ideal 
isotropic antenna \cite{AN91445}.

\section{Motivation for Designing BLE Modules }
One of the core ideas of the Inventvm BMS team is to make the BMS project in a wireless communication environment, therefore the team has decided to use Bluetooth as the communication tool. Hence, finding the big sharks (Bluetooth Hardware and stack) in the Bluetooth world took quite some time, after a long investigation; we concluded to pick two important pies in the Bluetooth cake such as STM BLUeNRG-355mc \cite{BLNRG355_STEVAL_GUIDE} and Nordic nRF52840 \cite{NORDIC_nrf52840_USERGUIDE}. BlueEnergy-355mc is the jewel of our projects because it owes the advantages of very low power consumption: 3.4 mA, Receiver sensitivity, Bluetooth low energy data extensions, high data rate so on... despite having these many advantages STM does not manufacture the Bluetooth modules other than eval boards. Henceforth, the team has been paralyzed to outsource the required Bluetooth modules, later in the same path we found MIDARTRONICS the company that manufactures the Bluetooth modules using the STM BLUeNRGgy-355mc hardware named STORMY. Stormy is a such cutie pie, at least it helps to some extent in R and D to prove the Wireless communication BMS architecture, but in the long run, we have experienced some the discomforts such as lack of documentation and market supply...to overcome all these issues team has decided to make inventive proprietary level Bluetooth modules for BMS project. This gave me the perfect timing and to opportunity design RF Bluetooth modules for the project, as part of my thesis which is dedicated to wireless communication BMS.\\
\indent Nordic nRF52840\cite{NORDIC_nrf52840_USERGUIDE} is another Bluetooth hardware similar to the BlueEnergy-355Mc reason behind picking the Nordic is the open BLE stack and Robust hardware. Nordic is much more comfortable in terms of different data rates, on-chip power converters, 32-bit ARM Cortex M4F @64MHz so and forth. Nordic has also a dedicated BLE stack \cite{NORDIC_nrf52840_SOFTWARESTACK_GUIDE} that handles all power management resources on-chip, which attracts low-power automobile applications. In a much broader sense, Nordic is additional Bluetooth hardware that we can provide to the customer according to the application's need.\\
\indent Though picking the Bluetooth hardware and stack is a boiling task, choosing the antenna and RF layout also takes prime place. Though, there are plenty of antennas for the 2.4GHz band, most Bluetooth manufacturers recommend two types of PCB antennas, meanders inverted antennas (MIFA) and inverted-F antenna (IFA), which are characterized and simulated exclusively for the low-power Bluetooth applications. However, MIFA (PIFA) is peculiar for most automobile applications because of its pointed directional properties.\\
\indent, However, we can choose any type of antenna and hardware for Bluetooth, admittedly the antenna, hardware, and RF layout design described in the following modules are classified for the BMS project.\\
\indent The Low Data rate and bandwidth requirement in Bluetooth applications make IFA and MIFA the two most atractive antennas for BLE.  Manufacturing these antennas is extremely easy because they are part of the PCB design. Certainly, these antennas are inexpensive as they are part of PCB and they provide good bandwidth in ranges for BLE in terms of 150 to 250 MHZ.MIFA is most preferable for smaller form factor PCBs such as a wireless mouse, wearable watches, handy IoT devices.... etc. IFA antennas are recommended for applications such as one of the dimensions is needed to be smaller than the other for example heart rate monitor.
The following modules explain MIFA and IFA antennas construction and functionalities:

\section{PCB Meandered Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA/MIFA)}

PIFA antennas are much more popular in Bluetooth Low Energy stack because of the small size, low profile and cost-effective compared to the conventional dipole and ceramic chip antennas.
The proposed structure (PIFA/MIFA) Figure \ref{fig:MIFA_Antenna_1} of the PIFA antenna is routed to gain all these advantages.
Replacing the conventional PCB trace in PIFA with the meandering line and meandering shorting strip
improves the efficiency of the PIFA as well as the bandwidth. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/MIFA_Antenna_radiation_direction.PNG}
	\caption{MIFA/PIFA antenna radiation direction}
	\label{fig:MIFA_RADIATION_DIRECTION}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:MIFA_Antenna_1} Taking the meandered shape on one side and connecting meandered terminal to the ground makes the radiation lobe a more directional Figure\ref{fig:MIFA_RADIATION_DIRECTION} that implicates the radiation of the meandered antenna.Meandered side of the antenna radiates very less power because the Menderes terminal is connected to the ground which nullifies most of the radiation on the backward side. This kind of feature is highly needed in extremely noisy environments such as automobiles, power grid applications, data servers....etc.
As a case study, the design and measurement results of the
proposed MIFA/PIFA are presented \cite{PIFA2017Cheuk} in Figure\ref{fig:MIFA_Antenna_1}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Antenna used in Inventvm BLE modules :}
\indent I got an opportunity complete the Inventvm BLE module antenna simulation Figure\ref{fig:MIFA_Antenna_1} to depict the typical board shape and the antenna placement \cite{NXPBLE_Antenna_Guide}. The RF shield housing has been removed for testing purposes, usually, Bluetooth modules provide RF housing to protect the BLE from external interference.

Some MIFA/PIFA antenna and PCB parameters that are used for the simulation are shown in the table \ref{tb:MIFA_ANTENNA_SIMULATION_PARAMETERS}.

\subsection{S11 of the MIFA/PIFA antenna}
Figure\ref{fig:MIFA_S11} shows the MIFA/PIFA antenna s11 parameter simulation results. The Bluetooth frequency bandwidth ranges from 2402 to 2483.5 MHz. The return loss of the antenna in the Bluetooth frequency band is less than the -10db.

	\caption{MIFA/PIFA antenna efficiency Simulation Results}
	\label{fig:MIFA_antenna_effieciency}
\end{figure}

\section{Inverterd-F Antenna:}
The inverted F antenna is also one of the popular antennae, recommended for the Low power stack BLE applications. IFA antennas host similar features to what MIFA/PIFA antennas offer but MIFA antennas are more recommended where is a space constraint and power radiation is in one direction. IFA antennas have bidirectional power radiation rather than mono-directional. Nordic Recommends in all designs to use the IFA antennas. Figure \ref{fig:IFA_Antenna_1} educates the typical design of the IFA antenna and simulation parameters are pretty much the same as it is used for the MIFA antenna Table \ref{tb:MIFA_ANTENNA_SIMULATION_PARAMETERS}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Chap03/Figures/IFA_antenna.PNG}
	\caption{IFA antenna design and the placement}
	\label{fig:IFA_Antenna_1}
\end{figure}

By the constructional nature of the IFA antennas are easy to match we can see that in the Figure \ref{fig:IFA_Antenna_reflection} IFA antenna is very well-matched at 2.4GHz. The S11 is quite impressive because it has a reflection coefficient at 2.4GHz is -27db and bandwidth at -9db is 160MHz.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{IFA antenna S11 and S22}
	\label{fig:IFA_Antenna_reflection}
\end{figure}
IFA antenna matching can be further tuned by varying the hinges, and length of the antennas, on contrary we need to compromise with power and resonant frequencies. Figure \ref{fig:IFA_S11_Change}shows the relative length and hinge width changes of the design Figure \ref{fig:IFA_Antenna_1} caused different frequency shfit, but they keep giving the best performance in matching.

\section{Conclusion of the Chapter \ref{chap:BLE}}
The simulation and design of both the MIFA and IFA antennas are successful the results have been presented in Chapter\ref{chap:BLE}.  
Both the MIFa and IFa antennas are well performed in the sense of the results and design, because of the industry standards and Bluetooth stack recommendations, from vendors I have opted MIFA for Inventvm Bluetooth modules. 
The Layout is also quite impressive considering all norms of RF PCB layout guidelines, which are mentioned in the chapter\ref{chap:BLE}.
In the chapter\ref{chap:BLE} I have not stressed the theoretical calculation for the MIFA/IFA antenna because the calculations are pretty much the same as the standard MIFA and IFA antennas, 
The goal is to bring up the sophisticated RF BLE layout according to the application with a standard approach. Yet reference papers [\cite{MIFA_Design_Losito},\cite{MIFA_IFA_difference_Kanan}] give more insight into the theocratical design of the MIFA / IFA antenna and 
I have taken fewer opportunities to explain the nordic architecture, because of the RF layout out-wise and in the antenna sense, I have followed the same guidelines as I did for the BLUeNRG-355mc.
The Complete layout of the BLUeNRG and Nordic is attached in the chapter\ref{chap:miselleneous} , Figures (\ref{fig:BLUeNRG-355mc_BLE_Layout},\ref{fig:Nordic_nrf52840_BLE_Layout}).
