\chapter{Battery SOC Estimation Algorithms}\label{ch:Battery_SOC_Estimation_Algorithms}
We require high-power storage batteries to meet the energy needs of multiple systems. The Lithium-ion batteries are the most popular varieties. Due to their safety, electrochemical structure, high number of charge/discharge cycles, high voltage, and high energy density, they are the most ideal rechargeable battery technologies. This battery type requires a particular charge technique called Constant Current- Constant Voltage (CC-CV) \cite{Coulomb_Counting_SOC_Estimation}.

\section{Summer of the Chapter \ref{ch:Battery_SOC_Estimation_Algorithms}}
All over in chapter \ref{ch:Battery_SOC_Estimation_Algorithms}, I took an effort to gather focus on the Kalman approach to estimating the soc, is it only the algorithm in the literature well certainly not there are plenty of approaches are there in the literature to estimate the soc of the battery. Then a very obvious question is why Kalman's approach? Well, the answer is it is very immune to noise and accurate estimation, and it has proven most algorithms over decades. As an extension of this topic, we can use much more advanced approaches with Kalman, for instance, fuzzy networks with Kalman filter, support vector machines with Kalman, and many others... I have limited this chapter to 3 or 4 (Amper second, Kalman, EKF, UKF, AUKF) types of algorithms for soc estimation. Even we can look into machine learning, AI, and neural network approaches like the random forest, gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent, etc. machine learning algorithms are more elegant and robust, but the drawback with those algorithms is we need a large amount of data to characterize the algorithms and tune, perhaps millions of data.  So it is not so easy to go ahead with the machine learning approach in smaller firms. Well, then Kalman's approach is the best among all? Not really it has drawbacks as well, but it holds sufficient grounds for estimating the battery soc.
